## Introduction
The **FullStack Template: Vue.js + Go Fiber** is a starter template for building web applications using **Vue.js** for the frontend and **GoFiber** for the backend. It supports user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and session management. Vue.js and Tailwind CSS are used to build responsive user interfaces.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, and **JWT** is used for session management.
- **JWT-Based Session Management**: JWT tokens are generated during login and stored in **HTTP-only cookies**.
- **Frontend**: Built with **Vue.js**, **Pinia** for state management, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Backend**: The backend is built with **Go Fiber** and provides several API routes for user actions like signing up, logging in, and accessing user profiles.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend uses Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and modern user interface.
